  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <p>
    I am a <a href="http://cs.cmu.edu/~rraghuna">Ph.D. student</a> at
    Carnegie Mellon University's <a href="http://scs.cmu.edu">School
    of Computer Science</a> advised by <a
    href="http://www.umut-acar.org">Umut Acar</a>. My research
    interests include incremental computation and parallel
    programming languages. I am especially interested in translating
    strong theoretical results into practical and useful
    systems.

    <p>
      Prior to starting my Ph.D., I was an Infrastructure Developer at
      <a href="http://tower-research.com">Tower Research
      Capital</a>. While there, I worked on improving the performance
      of the core pieces of infrastructure and the market data parsing
      and presentation layer. The ultra-high-performance bug bit me
      while I was there. You can learn more about my professional
      exploits from my <a href="/static/resume.pdf">resume</a>.
