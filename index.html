    <h2>Who I am</h2>
    <p>I am a currently a Ph.D. student advised
    by <a href="http://www.umut-acar.org">Umut Acar</a>. My research
    interests include incremental computation and programming
    models and languages for parallel programming. I am especially
    interested in translating strong theoretical results into
    practical and useful systems. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I was
    an Infrastructure Developer
    at <a href="http://tower-research.com">Tower Research Capital</a>.</p>
